## Leaders in the array
The algorithm will scan the array backwards. Every time it meets an item bigger than the last leader, will save him and update the last leader. To achieve constant memory, the algorithm will store each leader in the last free previous visited position. In fact at the k-th iteration we can have found at most (k - 1) leaders.

*Time complexity:* **O(n)**
*Space Complexity:* **O(1)**
